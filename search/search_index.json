The CLI is where you: Manage accounts. Claim addresses. Create keys for your addresses. Create workflows for your automations. And more. The first step is to download and install the executable. Install the CLI executable Install the CLI executable from the npm registry: mailscript with yarn global add mailscript or npm install global mailscript Account setup The next step is to initialize an account. The CLI uses a variety of identity providers, so choose the one you prefer. mailscript login Offline support The CLI offers a secondary login flow for setups without access to a browser instance (eg. a docker container). It will have ask you to go over a login flow elsewhere and return a code to resume the sign-in process within the CLI context. mailscript login --offline Initialize If this is the first time you are signing in you'll be prompted to pick a username. Once the you've has selected a username your account setup will be complete. Addresses Addresses allow you to send and receive email messages. You receive a top level domain address corresponding to your selected username (eg. username@mailscript.com ) and you can create addresses using your username as a first level subdomain (eg. team@username.mailscript.com ) You can create an address easily: mailscript addresses:add --address address@username.mailscript.com Keys Keys allow you to share scoped access ( write and/or read ) to addresses you control with other people. Whenever you add an address a key is generated with full access for you. You can list the keys for any address you control with the following command: mailscript keys:list --address [your email address] SMTP gateway Keys with the write access can be used to setup smtp access to allow email clients to send messages from any mailscript address. To do so use the following configuration: host: smtp.mailscrit.com port: 465 user: full address (eg. username@mailscript.com) pass: a key corresponding to the address with write access Next, you can start setting up workflows whenever your addresses receive an email message. Workflows Workflows allow you to setup automations when a message arrives at any of the addresses you control. A workflow consists of a trigger and an action. Whenever a trigger is met the corresponding actions will beexecuted. Triggers Currently mailscript allows you to set up triggers based on incoming messages to addresses you control. You can set criteria to filter specific messages to rigger actions (eg. messages sent from a specific address, messages that include attachments, that contain specific words in the subject or body, messages that contain attachments, mailscript even allows you to set up filters matching specific headers in your email message!) Actions Mailscript offers outputs based on three different kinds of actions that can happen when a trigger is met: Email actions: send a new email message, forward the received email message, redirect the message to another address and reply to the sender or all participants in the received message. SMS action: send an sms text to a specified number. Webhook action: send a request to an endpoint. The request can be customized to suit your needs (eg. customize verbs, headers and payload; you can even use data from the received message into the delivered payload).","title":"Get started"},{"location":"cli/get-started/#installation-and-account-setup","text":"To create an account, you first need to install the Mailscript CLI.
